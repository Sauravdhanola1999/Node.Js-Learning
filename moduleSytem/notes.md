1. The Node.js module system is a way to organize and reuse code. It allows developers to break down complex applications into smaller, manageable pieces called modules. These modules can be easily imported and used in other parts of the application, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

There are three main types of modules in Node.js

Built-in Modules:
These modules are included with Node.js and provide core functionalities such as file system access (fs), HTTP server creation (http), and path manipulation (path).
Local Modules:
These are modules created by the developer for specific application needs. They are typically stored in separate files and imported using relative paths.
Third-Party Modules:
These are modules created by the community and available through the Node Package Manager (npm). They provide a wide range of functionalities and can be installed using npm.


What are Modules in NodeJS?
A NodeJS module is a separate file containing code that can be imported and reused in other parts of the application. It helps break down large applications into smaller, manageable sections, each focused on a specific functionality. By using modules, developers can keep code organized, reusable, and maintainable.

Modules can contain

Variables
Functions
Classes
Objects


Types of Modules in NodeJS
ES6 Modules (ECMAScript Modules - ESM):-ES6 Modules offer a modern and standardized way to structure NodeJS applications. Unlike CommonJS, ESM uses import/export instead of require/module.exports.

How ES6 Modules Work?
Uses import to import modules.
Uses export to export functions, objects, or variables.
Modules are loaded asynchronously, allowing better performance.
Requires "type": "module" in package.json

CommonJS Modules (CJS):- CommonJS is the default module system used in NodeJS. It enables code modularity by allowing developers to export and import functions, objects, or variables using module.exports and require().

How CommonJS Works in NodeJS?
Uses require() to import modules.
Uses module.exports to export functions, objects, or variables.
Modules are loaded synchronously, meaning execution waits until the module is fully loaded.
It is default in NodeJS, but not natively supported in browsers.
Each module runs in its own scope, preventing variable conflicts.
